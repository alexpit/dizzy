**Dizzy: A Deezer client sandbox**

Deezer streaming service has a collection of web/native clients, which are making use of the public API & SDK published. At times, the subscribers of the streaming service are in the most uncomfortable position experiencing features that are explicitly disabled or no longer performing as expected.

A typical example: there's a long forum thread where subscribers complain without much hope about the "Hear this" feature being removed. It's hard to conceive how can subscribers be alienated is such manner by some decent service providers, but it's the reason this project came about :-)

Not all Deezer APIs are probably published, but the ones available are pretty good and could help access/build the features that have been denied or never been available in the official web/native clients of the streaming service.

This sandbox project is attempting to experiment and resurface some of those useful, sought after features.
